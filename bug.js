This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo Go app version and the SDK version specified in your project's `app.json` or `expo.json` file.  The Expo Go app needs to support the features used in your project, and an outdated app might not understand newer features or APIs, leading to an error during compilation or runtime.  This can manifest in various ways, sometimes without clear error messages, leading to strange behaviors.
